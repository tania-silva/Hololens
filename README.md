# Denial of Service on HoloLens via Device Portal functionalities

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to overload a target system in such a way that it gradually becomes unable to respond to all the requests sent to it. This way, a legitimate user loses access to a service, which, depending on the application domain, can be crucial to their process. For this issue, we analyzed the HoloLens headsets that provide a Mixed Reality (MR)
experience. The HoloLens 1 and 2 provide a framework to manage and manipulate the content and functionalities on the HoloLens remotely. The tool is called the ”Device Portal,” as shown in Figure 1.1, and allows the user to manage applications, documents, and multimedia content stored on the head-mounted device. This tool also enables realtime visualization of the user’s activities on the device and immediate recording or screen capturing. Additionally, this tool enables the monitoring of system components, as well as managing processes that are running at the moment on the system.
